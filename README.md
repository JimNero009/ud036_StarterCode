# Movie Site

This small website is dedicated to some of my favourite movies around. To run it, simply do the following:

 - Install python 3 on your machine
 - Clone this repository to get it locally
 - Run the application with `python3 entertainment_centre.py`

A webpage will appear with movie titles and posters. Simply click on the posters to watch the trailer for any given film in a popup.
